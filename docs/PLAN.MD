* [ ] Implement difficulty progression algorithms

### Catherine Bot

* [ ] Generate UI component specifications and layouts
* [ ] Create responsive design patterns for cross-platform compatibility
* [ ] Implement UI animations and interaction effects
* [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
* [ ] Design asset specifications for balloon graphics

### David Bot

* [ ] Integrate Google AdMob SDK for ad monetization
* [ ] Implement banner and interstitial ads with proper lifecycle management
* [ ] Develop rewarded video ad logic with callback handling
* [ ] Create and test premium (no-ads) in-app purchase flow
* [ ] Implement ad frequency capping and user experience optimization

### Emily Bot

## Development Milestones

* **Sprint 1:** Project scaffolding, core architecture, initial gameplay loop
* **Sprint 2:** Complete game mechanics, ad integration, UI implementation
* **Sprint 3:** Testing automation, performance optimization, iOS-specific features
* **Sprint 4:** Final integration testing, deployment preparation, documentation

## Code Quality Standards

* All code must follow SOLID principles and dependency injection patterns
* Comprehensive unit test coverage (>90%) required
* Pure functions preferred for game logic calculations
* Interface-based design for all major components
* Clean separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers

---

## Notes

* Each AI bot maintains independent task execution
* Automated testing pipeline validates all changes
* Continuous integration ensures code quality standards
* All dependencies must be injected for testability
